# header thingy

here are all the mods for the server. the main branch has all the mods that are absolutely necessary to play on the server. the other branch (click "main" then "jonathan-mods") has some extra mods that i use that add various QOL features but are completely optional.

## well how do i download stuf????!1!!?

click on "code", then "download ZIP". extract the zip file by clicking "extract all" on windows. there's probably an equivalent on mac. if you're using linux you already know how to do this.

then drop all the jar files into your mods folder.

this repo is here for those who haven't played in a while and want to make sure all the versions are correct and to see what mods are updated. sometimes you'll want to just delete everything and copy everything over, but most of the time you can just check the commits, see what mods have been updated and go from there.
